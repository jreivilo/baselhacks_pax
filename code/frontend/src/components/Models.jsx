    executiveSummary: 'Underwriters consistently noted that applicants with elevated BMI (>27) should not be automatically rejected when they demonstrate high sports activity frequency (5+ times/week). Comments emphasized that regular physical activity indicates cardiovascular health and metabolic fitness, which offsets BMI concerns. Multiple underwriters highlighted cases where active individuals with BMI 28-30 were healthier overall than sedentary applicants with lower BMI.',

    executiveSummary: 'Underwriter comments reveal that age-based rejection should consider occupation type. Cases show underwriters accepting applicants up to age 65 when they have moderate occupational risk levels, noting that professional and desk-based roles have lower physical wear. Comments consistently argue that blanket age limits penalize low-risk occupations unnecessarily and that risk stratification must account for occupational demands.',

Comments state that risk diminishes significantly after extended cessation periods for individuals without pre-existing lung conditions.
